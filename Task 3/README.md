# Password Generator

## Overview

A password generator is a crucial tool for enhancing online security. This Python project offers a simple yet powerful password generator application. It allows users to create strong and random passwords by specifying the desired length and complexity.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application prompts users to input their name, desired password length, and complexity level, making it easy for anyone to use.

- **Password Complexity:** Users can choose from low, medium, or high complexity levels. The generator employs a mix of random characters, including numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), special characters, and whitespace, based on the selected complexity.

- **Customizable Length:** Users can specify the length of the password, making it suitable for various security requirements.

3. Specify the desired password length.
4. Choose the complexity level (Low, Medium, or High).
5. Click the "Generate Password" button.
6. The application will generate a strong, random password.
7. To generate another password, simply repeat the process.
8. Click the "Reset" button to clear the form.

## Customization and Extension

This project serves as a foundation for creating a password generator application. You can customize and extend it to include additional features, such as:

- Saving generated passwords to a file.
- Generating multiple passwords at once.
- Generating passwords for specific purposes (e.g., website logins, Wi-Fi passwords).

Feel free to explore and adapt this application to suit your specific security needs.
