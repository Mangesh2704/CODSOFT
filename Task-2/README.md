# Simple Calculator using Python and Tkinter

## Overview

This Python code demonstrates the creation of a basic calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The calculator allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The calculator provides a clean and user-friendly interface with a display to enter and view mathematical expressions.

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Users can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

- **Clear Function:** The "C" button clears the input field, allowing users to start fresh.

- **Error Handling:** The calculator handles errors gracefully and displays "Error" in case of invalid expressions.

## Usage

1. Enter a mathematical expression in the input field.
2. Use the numeric buttons (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /) to build your expression.
3. Click the "=" button to calculate the result.
4. To clear the input field, click the "C" button.

## Customization and Extension

This code serves as a starting point for creating a basic calculator application. You can customize and expand it to add more advanced features such as support for parentheses, scientific functions, memory functions, and more.

Feel free to explore and enhance this application further to meet specific project requirements.

## Dependencies

- Tkinter Library (typically included with Python)
